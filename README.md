+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for grayscale images of poodles versus images of fried chickens. The baseline model uses gradient boosting machine with decision stumps on 5000 SIFT features. Our advanced models include linear and kernel SVM (support vector machine), KNN(k-nearest neighbors) on both the HoG-features and the SIFT features. Our best performance baseline model achieved an accuracy of 74% and 88% for the advanced model.
